- Error check inputs to predict()
- Explore ways to improve speed of predict():
	o In for (b in uB):
		- Could re-construct algo so that we only invert each matrix once.
		- Identify overlap of n1 and n2 so that some of these matrix computations might be reduced.
- Explore ways to improve speed of spacious.fit():
	o In update_theta():
		- Figure out if it is possible to compute/invert cov matrices once since it's done in update_beta() as well.
	o See if there are ways to improve the way we identify convergence of fit.
	o Look for ways to speed up standard error computations
- In spacious():
	o Error check inputs
	o Warn if too high a % of data is in a single block
	o Consider moving computation of D (if needed) to spacious.fit()
- In summary():
	o Figure out how to make nice tables of results
- Add source/reference for mean_max_temps data set
- Add prediction variances as an output for predict()
